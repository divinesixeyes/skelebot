# skelebot
skeleton code for discord.js bot ! great for those getting started :)

this code is written entirely in js and utilizes the discord.js library.
please do not use this code to spoonfeed yourself. please learn as much as possible from the notes given and the documentation listed below.

this code includes a fully functional command handler along with a few example commands.
this does not include slash commands & other integrations. i hope to soon push another example code with integrations utilized.

i'm not the most professional nor knowledgable programmer. take my words with a grain of salt and PLEASE read the documentation provided. 

this project utilizes discord.js v14.11 and will occasionally be maintained. 
this isn't built for scaling, but just to get your foot in the door.
